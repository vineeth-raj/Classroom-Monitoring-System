## Introduction
As a student, we feel like leaving the classroom, frustated due to boring lectures and we always wanted
the lecturer to know about our feelings.In olden era it is quite not possible, but in this deep learning
era we made it possible.Also it is very important to understand that the way lectures are delivered in
college or school is very important in shaping the career of students.Hence we came up with a solution
that can let the lecturer not only know about the students emotion but also he knows the gestures through
which he can make further moves.

## Objective
The main objectives of this system are:

- Make the attendance system flexible (biometric)
- Make the teachers and principal understand the interest of students on  the lectures by identifying their emotions and sitting postures.
- Automatic Notes taker.
